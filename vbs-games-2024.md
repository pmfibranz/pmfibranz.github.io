> The sum of your word is truth,  
> and every on of your righteous rules endures forever.  
> _- Psalm 119:160 -_

- Players had to determine what was the truth and what was a lie. We must do this in life as well. Remind kids of Psalm 119:160
- Say: "Some people will say things like, 'Truth can be different for different people,' but we know that truth comes from God."

_Bible/Life Application: It might have been discouraging to be in the circle. When people disagree with us, it can be discouraging. Some people say, "If you don't agree with me, you don't love me." Similar to our game, these people might feel like they're being attacked when someone disagrees with them, but God says to speak the truth in love. (See Ephesians 4:15)_

- After a few seconds, call out a number
- Kids must quickly run to a beach towel and sit down on it in a group of that number. (ex. If you call out , "Three," kids must sit in groups of three on the towels)
- If any kids do not successfully find a group of the number called out, they are out but may take turns calling out the next number
- Continue play as time allows, taking away beach towels as the remaining kids playing becomes fewer

_Add music and pause then call out numbers._  
_Maybe try: Instead of eliminating players who don't find a group of the correct number, challenge them to complete a task, such as do 6 jumping jacks, give 4 people high-fives, etc. before playing the next round._
